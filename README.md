### Stayshine Development Website

This is the original Stayshine Web Development homepage. It was created in mid-2014 using basic HTML5 techniques, CSS with SCSS and JavaScript with jQuery. The site is responsive, one of the first fully responsive start to finish builds by Stayshine developers. 

When Stayshine started this Github organization wasn't created yet and there weren't any plans to develop the Stayshine homepage further so it was never pushed to Github. If you want to make changes to the site feel free, as any changes are made to the site so will they be made here. The website doesn't even use a database to house its news/blog because it was such a trivial amount of data that building a mini CMS or integrating one wouldn't have even been worth the while. So another update that would be much appreciated would be a way to manage the content on the site.

We decided to drop the site into the Google Web Starter kit mainly for use of the gulpfile. When the site was first created it was minified through web tools and styles were pre-processed in SCSS via ruby on the command line. Now it is easier to use a single gulpfile which manages minification and pre-processing.

> Note: Currently this page is pulling a 99/100 Page Speed and 99/100 UI on both mobile and desktop.
