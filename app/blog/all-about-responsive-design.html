        What is responsive web design and why is it so important for small businesses to utilize this tool in 2014? The answer is not complicated, responsive web design caters to the needs of the consumer, and in this age of digital bliss that is really the most important factor in online web development. Let's not talk buzz-words or filler though, let’s just talk about "Responsive Web Design" and what it means to you.

        Is there a difference between responsive and mobile, YES! There is a big difference. The major defining characteristic of a responsive website is that it optimizes your layout and site content to support users on any type of device. Mobile websites limit user experience and downgrade content in an attempt to load quicker on small devices. Please note that having two separate websites also dilutes your search engine optimization attempts in half due to the fact that you have two separate websites fighting for page rank. Mobile websites were a passing phase, they served their purpose for a moment in history and now they are dead. Mobile versions of websites existed to bridge the gap in technology that existed in the not so distant past. Today, a new smart phone has a faster processor than your average home PC sported off the shelf just five years ago. It’s amazing; we are now able to serve visitors to our sites premium content no matter if they are on a cell phone, tablet, laptop or PC. HTML5 web technologies have given us many ways to gracefully degrade and progressively enhance our sites so there is no need for a mobile site and a main site. Users all come to one site, the responsive site. They are served the same content on any device, the only difference is usually the layout, which is styled according to device to provide the best experience for the client, not the network.

        If you are not a web developer, allow me to explain quickly that content and style are written separately when designing pages on the web. This means that all the words on a page, images, videos, links, lists, containers, ect., are written in an HTML file, they are your structure and content. Then all the styling is done completely separate in what we call a CSS (cascading style sheet) file. This is how we are able to send everyone the same content/structure, and yet depending on what type of device they are browsing your site on, they get to see a completely differently laid out page that best suits their devices size and capabilities. The structure and content (the HTML) remains the same, it's the CSS styles that are changed depending on various factors, the largest and most widely used being screen size.

        Since responsive web design doesn't redirect browsers to different sites and the structure of your website remains the same across the board, search engines and screen readers will still interpret the site properly. In 2014 we expect a little over half of all web browsing to be done on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Imagine having to maintain one site for desktops and laptops and another for mobile devices. It would be difficult, all your search engine optimization efforts would be cut in half, your business would not be able to perform perfect upkeep on two websites without roughly twice as much man hours, so half of your visitors would most likely get a subpar experience. Luckily, responsive websites are easier to maintain, offer a better and more consistent user experience, and they don't require any special technology to determine what sort of device site visitors are using. It is all done with the very widely supported CSS media queries.

        The only problem with responsive websites, is not having one. Forbes stated that companies without responsive websites may have to prepare to go out of business in 2014. Luckily, your old website can easily be upgraded or a new one can be designed.
