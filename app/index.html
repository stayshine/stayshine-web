          <strong>April 21, 2015</strong> Google began a shift in it’s search mechanics to favor websites that offer users a mobile friendly surfing experience.

This is very true, very important, and members of the web development community have been pushing for this sort of standard now for a couple years, it is called responsive design. Stayshine web developers can make you and search engines indexing your site happy by making sure that your website meets the important standards that qualify as "mobile friendly". On top of making Google happy, it will give your visitors a better user experience and make them happy as well.

      <h2><b class="headline"><u>Small business website SEO</u></b></h2>
      <p>
        Your businesses website SEO (search engine optimization) is very important to its success. This includes using the right keywords through your page to establish relevancy with the search engines. Stayshine developers are up to date with SEO practices and will bake the best practiced methods right into your website. This will ensure that your company will be able to use whatever means of marketing on and off of your website and not have to worry about being penalized by the search engines trying to gain rank the wrong way or what is referred to as “Black Hat SEO”. After we build your website we will show you diagnostics run by third party programs that test to make sure your webpages were built correctly.  This way you will be sure that your business is getting the best possible designed website for the money.
      </p>
      <h3><b class="headline">On-site SEO</b></h3>
      <p>
        Your sites on-page SEO consists of using the right keywords throughout your page, which we will work with you to create, and then making sure to write relevant content matching those keywords. On top of that there are certain methods to website programming and laying out content, images and meta-data that will give your small business great success starting with its on-site SEO. If you allow a company to build a site for you that does not have good SEO built into the actual coding of the site, then you will be working extra hard trying to get search engines to notice your page. The best small business web design solution to SEO is to have a well-made page, with regularly updated, unique and well maintained content. This means that you will have to update your content regularly after your site is launched. Stayshine developers can assist you in doing this yourself or we can help you to achieve the right amount of up to date content to stay relevant.
